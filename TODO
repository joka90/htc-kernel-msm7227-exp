*Check if it's working by compiling iw and libnl. - iw and libnl compiling with cyanogen sources now
* fix auto loading of modules. and prio order/dependensis
*Port to legend's cyanogen build

Status:
To compile compat wireless I had to remove some defines, You will see...
Working and loading modules with out some errors from compat wireless 2.6.39
tiwlan is (working/compiled) as unstable as before...

    *Enable building of wpa_supplicant in your BoardConfig.mk 

This is by simply adding following options in BoardConfig.mk:

   BOARD_WPA_SUPPLICANT_DRIVER := WEXT
   WPA_SUPPLICANT_VERSION      := VER_0_6_X
   WIFI_DRIVER_MODULE_PATH     := "/system/etc/wifi/wl12xx_sdio.ko"
   WIFI_DRIVER_MODULE_ARG      := ""
   WIFI_DRIVER_MODULE_NAME     := "wl12xx_sdio"
   WIFI_DRIVER_FW_STA_PATH     := "/system/etc/firmware/ti-connectivity/wl1271-fw-2.bin"

Patch wpa sup

Android uses SIOCSIWPRIV ioctl to send commands to modify driver behaviour and receive information like signal strength, mac address of the AP, link speed etc. This ioctl is usually not implemented. A quick workaround was to emulate this ioctl functionality in WPA_supplicant itself. Here is the corresponding patch Added emulation of Android private ioctls for generic WiFi drivers
